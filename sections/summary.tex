\section{Summary}

I am an experienced software engineer who has worked on a range of different domains, problems, and technologies. My main focus throughout my career has been on excellence and best practices â€“ both cultural and engineering.\\

This is evidenced by my time at the BBC and Tracsis, where I have promoted and encouraged well-tested, clean code through a combination of fast-feedback loops, TDD, best practices such as pair programming, and creating a safe working environment. Through this focus, I have been instrumental in shaping and forming positive team culture and engineering best practices, whilst taking lead on green-field projects critical to achieving business and organisational goals - such as designing and building out the CI/CD pipeline for the newly created Universal App Platform.\\

My ambition is to help shape agile teams, to enable them to innovate and move quickly. As an example of this, I consistently promoted feature-toggle based development to enable a smoother continuous delivery process, and introduced pair programming to the engineering department at Tracsis, increasing collective ownership and shared knowledge of the domain, thus greatly reducing risk and cost of new feature development.\\

All in all, I view software as a team enterprise and I am a believer in the value of the principles of extreme programming. This involves a strong emphasis on pair/mob programming and including all disciplines in the software-creation process as early as possible, coupled with expert knowledge of the technologies involved.\\
